# Replicating Numpy Mean Method with Python OOP

This project demonstrates a simple Python class `numpy_clone` that mimics Numpy's `.mean()` method for both 1D and 2D arrays. The class is built using basic Python concepts such as indexing, list methods, object-oriented programming (OOP), and manual mean calculations. 

The implementation is tested for accuracy by comparing its output with Numpy's `.mean()` method, and both return 100% identical results.

## Features
The `numpy_clone` class provides two methods for calculating the mean:
- **`array_1d_mean()`**: Computes the mean of a 1-dimensional list.
- **`array_2d_mean(axis=None)`**: Computes the mean of a 2-dimensional list. It supports axis-based mean calculation, similar to Numpy:
  - `axis=None`: Computes the mean of the entire 2D array.
  - `axis=0`: Computes the mean along the columns.
  - `axis=1`: Computes the mean along the rows.

## Code Explanation

```python
class numpy_clone:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def array_1d_mean(self):
        return sum(self.data) / len(self.data)

    def array_2d_mean(self, axis=None):
        if axis is None:
            sum_data = 0
            num_of_data = len(self.data) * len(self.data[0])
            for i in range(len(self.data)):
                for j in range(len(self.data[i])):
                    sum_data += self.data[i][j]
            return sum_data / num_of_data

        elif axis == 0:
            mean = []
            for j in range(len(self.data[0])):
                sum_data = 0
                for i in range(len(self.data)):
                    sum_data += self.data[i][j]
                mean.append(sum_data / len(self.data))
            return mean

        elif axis == 1:
            mean = []
            for i in range(len(self.data)):
                sum_data = sum(self.data[i])
                mean_of_each_row = sum_data / len(self.data[i])
                mean.append(mean_of_each_row)
            return mean

        else:
            raise ValueError("Axis has to be None, 0, or 1")
```

### 1D Mean Calculation
The method `array_1d_mean()` calculates the mean for a 1D array by using Python's built-in `sum()` function and dividing it by the length of the list.

### 2D Mean Calculation
The method `array_2d_mean(axis=None)` computes the mean of a 2D array based on the axis parameter:
- **When `axis=None`**: It sums all elements of the 2D array and divides by the total number of elements.
- **When `axis=0`**: It calculates the mean for each column.
- **When `axis=1`**: It calculates the mean for each row.

If an invalid axis value is provided, the method raises a `ValueError`.

## Example Usage

```python
# Example for 1D array
data_1d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
clone = numpy_clone(data_1d)
print(clone.array_1d_mean())  # Output: 3.0

# Example for 2D array
data_2d = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
clone_2d = numpy_clone(data_2d)

# Mean of entire 2D array
print(clone_2d.array_2d_mean())  # Output: 5.0

# Mean along axis 0 (columns)
print(clone_2d.array_2d_mean(axis=0))  # Output: [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]

# Mean along axis 1 (rows)
print(clone_2d.array_2d_mean(axis=1))  # Output: [2.0, 5.0, 8.0]
```

## Installation

To run this project, you don't need any additional packages besides Python. However, to compare results, you might want to install Numpy.

To install Numpy, run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Testing the Accuracy

You can test the accuracy of the `numpy_clone` class by comparing its output with Numpy's `.mean()` method:

```python
import numpy as np

# For 1D array
data_1d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
clone = numpy_clone(data_1d)
assert np.mean(data_1d) == clone.array_1d_mean()

# For 2D array
data_2d = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
clone_2d = numpy_clone(data_2d)

# Compare mean of entire array
assert np.mean(data_2d) == clone_2d.array_2d_mean()

# Compare mean along axis 0
assert np.mean(data_2d, axis=0).tolist() == clone_2d.array_2d_mean(axis=0)

# Compare mean along axis 1
assert np.mean(data_2d, axis=1).tolist() == clone_2d.array_2d_mean(axis=1)
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a simple, yet effective, implementation of Numpy-like mean calculation using basic Python concepts. It can be a helpful learning tool for those looking to understand how Numpy functions work behind the scenes and for practicing object-oriented programming in Python.
